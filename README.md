# Multilayer Perceptron Classification

This repository contains a **Java** implementation of a classification based on a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) with three hidden layers. The activation functions for the hidden layers are defined as follows:

1. **Hidden Layers Activation Functions:**
   - Logistic Function (sigmoid)
   - Hyperbolic Tangent Function (tanh(u))
   - Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)

2. **Output Layer Activation Function:**
   - The activation function for the output layer is the Logistic Function.

**You can customize the activation functions and the number of neurons for the hidden layers based on your requirements. Simply modify the corresponding sections in the code.**
